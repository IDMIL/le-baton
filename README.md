# Le Bâton

Le Bâton is a DMI built by Matt Skarha at the [Input Devices and Music Interaction Laboratory (IDMIL)](http://www-new.idmil.org/) at McGill University. The project began in 2017 where a proof-of-concept was constructed as a final project for a class in the [TIMARA](https://www.timara.oberlin.edu/) Department at the [Oberlin Conservatory of Music](https://www.oberlin.edu/conservatory). The latest version was funded by a grant from the [Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT)](cirmmt.org) in Montréal, QC and will be published in the [New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) 2021 Conference](http://nime2021.org/). 

This repository hosts up-to-date firmware, software, and schematics for Le Bâton. Additional information about the project can be found in the NIME 2021 paper:
